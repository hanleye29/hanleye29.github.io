I was talking with an established Data Science Manager at my company about what I could do to improve my data science skillset. His advice was to achieve my AWS Cloud Practitioner Certification. Up to this point, I knew that Amazon Redshift was a popular data warehousing solution used by a number of businesses, but I really wasn't familiar with AWS outside of that - or cloud computing in general.

What I found was absolutely astounding! You always hear about Amazon being this goliath entity - I'd always associated them with the nice books or trinkets or dog costumes I order that arrive in my doorstep just a few hours later. But even with how impressive their resale and distribution segments (Amazon North America/International) are - AWS has convinced me that Amazon will probably end up ruling the world. That's because AWS owns **32% of the Cloud Infrastructure Provider Market** - which is a $130 Billion market.

Alright cool, but what's Cloud Infrastucture? According to AWS:

> Cloud computing is the on-demand delivery of IT resources over the Internet with pay-as-you-go pricing. Instead of buying, owning, and maintaining physical data centers and servers, you can access technology services, such as computing power, storage, and databases, on an as-needed basis from a cloud provider like Amazon Web Services (AWS).

Let'break that down a little - how can you access technology services like the ones described above without buying, owning, and maintaining physical data centers and servers? Well, Amazon already owns a ton of them. And they're everywhere.
