**S3, Buckets, & Objects**

Amazon RDS is a service provided by AWS that allows you to automatically set up, operate, and scale relational databases in the cloud. This service covers a lot of the tedious IT infrastructure work associated with developing your own databases on private servers like hardware provisioning, database setup, patching and backups so that AWS RDS users can focus on application development.

You can run a DB instance on a virtual private cloud (VPC) using the Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC) service. When you use a VPC, you have control over your virtual networking environment. You can choose your own IP address range, create subnets, and configure routing and access control lists.
