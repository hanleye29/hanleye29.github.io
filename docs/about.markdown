## Welcome to my Data Science Page!

My name is Eric Hanley. I'm currently a Process Development & Manufacturing Engineer II for Creganna Medical (a TE Connectivity business) in Minneapolis, MN. I'm also pursuing my Master of Business Analytics at Krannert School of Business, Purdue University in the hopes of transitioning to a career in Data Science.

I've worked in Process Development & Manufacturing over the past three years in heavy engines, aerospace, and now med-tech. The main takeaway from my experiences: the individuals and businesses that better utilize their data (in supply chain, manufacturing process improvement, and process development) are always more successful. In manufacturing especially, there are those who use tribal knowledge, experience, and heuristics to make decisions. This can work on a relatively small scale or when you have long-tenured domain experts, but when it is time to expand or when those experts retire - this patchwork decision making apparatus will begin to fail. How to resolve this? Data-Driven Decision Making.

Working in process development & manufacturing has given me a great opportunity to work with a variety of product, logistics, and process data - albeit on a smaller scale than a Data Scientist typically would. I apply statistical methodologies (DOE, T-Tests, Descriptive Statistics, etc.) on a daily basis to ensure our processes and products meet the highest requirements laid out by our customers, and the FDA. I am deeply steeped in Lean/Six-Sigma Methodology. Implementing process changes that have real, tangible impact on the business requires methodical data acquisition, analysis, and presentation to stakeholders. And this is by far my favorite part of the job - being confident in a course of action because we have the data to prove it.

I applied to Purdue's Business Analytics program and have begun independently honing my technical skills as well. Running SQL Queries, cleaning, handling and analyzing dataframes in Python and R, and creating visualizations in Tableau are just some of the skills that I've picked up and continue to work with on a daily basis. I achieved my AWS Cloud Practitioner Certification in June 2021 and have begun putting together personal projects involving RDS, Lambda, EC2 instances, and a number of other Cloud Computing resources to try and tap into the power and potential of these services.

This journey is amazing to me, and I love learning more about it everyday. Please check out my portfolio, blog, etc. and let me know if you'd ever like to collaborate or have any questions!
