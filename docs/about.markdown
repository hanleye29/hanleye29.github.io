## Welcome to my Data Science Page!

My name is Eric Hanley. I'm currently a Data Science Consultant working for Accenture based out of Minneapolis, MN. I'm also pursuing my Master of Business Analytics at Krannert School of Business, Purdue University to further enhance my data science skillset and expand my business accumen. The purpose of this site is to showcase my technical skills and hopefully help people that have similar questions that I've had as I've progressed into a career as a data scientist.

Prior to becoming a Data Science Consultant, I worked in supply chain and manufacturing as an engineer in the energy, aerospace, and med-tech industries. The main takeaway from my experiences: the individuals and businesses that better utilize their data (in supply chain, manufacturing process improvement, and process development) are always more successful. My previous roles have given me great opportunities to work with a variety of product, logistical, and process data. I've apply statistical methodologies (DOE, T-Tests, Descriptive Statistics, etc.) to ensure our processes and products met the highest requirements laid out by our customers and regulatory agencies. I am deeply steeped in Lean/Six-Sigma Methodology.

Working as a Data Science Consultant for Accenture has given me a fantastic opportunity to apply my machine learning, data strategy, and digital transformation skillsets to provide real, tangible value and guidance for our clients. Working with diverse teams in different industries, I've been able to work with big data from a myriad of sources to provide strategic guidance, road maps, and machine learning assets to solve real business problems.

As mentioend above, I joined Purdue's Business Analytics program in Winter 2020 and have continue independently honing my technical skills as well. Working with data pipelines, cleaning, handling and analyzing dataframes in Python and R, and creating visualizations in Tableau are just some of the skills that I've picked up and continue to work with on a daily basis. I've deepened my domain knowledge in supply chain processes, and business management. I achieved my AWS Cloud Practitioner Certification in June 2021 and have begun putting together personal projects involving RDS, Lambda, EC2 instances, and a number of other Cloud Computing resources to try and tap into the power and potential of these services.

This journey is amazing to me, and I love learning more about it everyday. Please check out my portfolio, blog, etc. and let me know if you'd ever like to collaborate or have any questions! All work posted here is my own original work, none of it is derived from work-related data sources, methods, or practices, and all views expressed are strictly my own.
